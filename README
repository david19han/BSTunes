This program reads the iTunes data file that stores the track information
in XML.  It provides a very simple interface to get the tracks out as a
list.

The ITunesPlaylistReader does most of the work by parsing the XML file
(ugly!) and creating the track list.  The track class is also necessary
since it represents the track information the students wil be processing.
Main and TitleComparator are simply included as example classes.

library.xml is provided as an example data file.


To run the program, type one of the following:
 java -classpath xerces.jar:. Main
 java -classpath xerces_for_itunes.jar:. Main

In the first example, the students must get the ITunesPlaylistReader file
as part of the project and compile it with their program (in case you or
they want to modify it (not recommended)). In the second case, it is 
bundled into the jar file and so is not needed by the students directly.

Have fun!
