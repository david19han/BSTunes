#BSTunes

This program reads the iTunes data file that stores the track information
in XML.  It provides a very simple interface to get the tracks out as a
list and creates a "database" system for iTunes tracks. Each track has information including its title, musician, genre, playing time, and so forth. In order to efficiently find tracks based on any of these properties, we can store track information in binary search trees. BSTs are implemented in an object-oriented manner.
